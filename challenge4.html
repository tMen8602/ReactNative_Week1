<!-- Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%. Your tasks: 1. Calculate the tip,
depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement � (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!) 2. Print a string
to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25” Test data: § Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430 -->
